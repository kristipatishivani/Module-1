# Experiment No:Varibles and Expressions, Operators - using two values using all the relational operators

## AIM
To write a Python program for two values using all the relational operators (>,<,>=,<=,== ,!=).

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Start Assign values a = 13 and b = 33
3. Compare a and b using > , < , >= , <= , == , !=
4. Print the results of each comparison Stop 

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-
#Name-
#Write your code here
a = 13
b = 33
# a > b is False
print(a > b)
# a < b is True
print(a < b)
# a == b is False
print(a == b)
# a != b is True
print(a != b)
# a >= b is False
print(a >= b)
# a <= b is True
print(a <= b)
```
